## API Integration
- **Primary API:** CoinGecko API for fetching real-time data and historical data.
- **Additional APIs:** Use additional APIs to fetch data on public companies holding Bitcoin and Ethereum (if required).

## Development Considerations
- **API Key:** Ensure to generate an API key and check the limits on requests per minute and per day.
- **State Management:** Use any state management library (Redux/Redux Toolkit, Zustand, Jotai).
- **Loading, Error, and Empty States:** Handle loading, error, and empty states appropriately.
- **Folder Structure:** Follow a standard, well-defined folder structure.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure the UI is responsive and supports multiple screen sizes.
- **Deployment:** Deploy the working code on any website hosting platform (GitHub, Vercel, Netlify, Firebase).
- **Third-Party Libraries:** Avoid using utility libraries such as underscore.js, lodash, day.js.
- **Graph Libraries:** You can use a third-party library for line graphs.
- **Caching:** Cache API responses (with expiration) for all the pages.
- **UI Creativity:** Explore and use creativity to come up with a unique yet usable UI.

## Brownie Points
- **Dynamic Theme Switching:** Implement a dynamic theme-switching feature for toggling between Light and Dark modes.
- **Server-Side Rendering:** Utilize Next.js's server-side rendering capabilities.
- **Search Bar Suggestions:** Integrate a feature in the search bar to display recently searched items as suggestions.
- **Mock Live Price Ticker:** Simulate a live price ticker using a Pub-Sub mechanism, providing real-time updates on the product page.
 
## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### API and Data Handling
**Q: What happens if the API request limit is reached?**
- If the API request limit is reached, the website may temporarily stop fetching new data until the limit resets. You may see a message indicating that the API limit has been reached and suggesting you try again later.

 
**Q: What are the common API errors and rate limits?**
- Common API errors include exceeding the rate limit, invalid API keys, and network issues. Each API provider has specific rate limits, which are typically documented on their website.
